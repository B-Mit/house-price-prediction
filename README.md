# house-price-prediction

This porject uses a dataset pf housing features (like number of rooms, area (m^2) of house, number of bathrooms, etc) to predict the selling price of a house. I have used two regression models namely Linear and KNN Regression to predict the selling price and a house and compare which model performs better.
